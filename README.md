# Django_form_creation_app
A series of Django apps which will be used to generate infosec reports and documents.
for initial setup in python Due to the removal of the long-deprecated pkgutil.ImpImporter class, the pip command may not
 work for Python 3.12. You just have to manually install pip for Python 3.12

"python -m ensurepip --upgrade"
"python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools"
